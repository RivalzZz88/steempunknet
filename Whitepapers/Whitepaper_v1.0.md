The idea
------

In this concept we will create the first steps of establishing a Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game based 
upon the steemit blockchain.

Player should have the possibility to challenge other players and attack them, while the 
opponents are able to defend themselves. This very basic thought should be based upon the 
blockchain of steemit, which limits player numbers to all steemit users at maximum.

Players are able to boost their stats using different potions and items. These items can either be found in 
the world of STEEMPUNK-NET, or they can be acquired within a shopsystem shipped within the software.

The game itself should enhance the user experience on steemit and support the active collaboration on this platform. 
Actions that are in favor of exactly doing that are rewarded in different ways within the game, we will 
explain this more in detail in the upcoming chapters.

Setting this game into the steampunk genre and accompanying it with a rich storyline is adding atmosphere and also 
creates the opportunity to identify with the character that the user is playing.


Market potential
------

To check if this idea has any market potential we launched a proposal on Steemit. The account that authored the post 
was only 3 weeks on the platform and the reach of the posting can for sure be considered as low. 
Nevertheless it had 156 votes after 2 days and the reaction within the comments was absolutely positive. 
All in all the Post earned 8 $ and the followers of the account doubled.
This post was only done in german, so the whole international community was not addressed. 

On 09/26 a second Teaser was launched, this time with more informations and in both, english and german. 
This post was received extremely positive and had 256 votes, earned 70 $ and has 126 comments, 
including the answers that have been written by the team. All of them were encouraging and positive except two.

Based upon these clear signs of a market and the own estimations of the team we come to the conclusion 
that the market potential of such a new kind of game, based upon a blockchain is an absolute given.


The game
------


### Character classes

The game will be launched with two character classes to choose from.

**The Wanderer (Adventurer)**

The wanderer is the allrounder in the world of STEEMPUNK-NET. 
His abilities are not very much specialized at character creation, he is literally the jack of all trades. 
He is able to develop into any kind of specialist imaginable.

**The Aristocrat**

Born as being part of the ruling class a lot of his time got invested into training his mental abilities. 
He is not very experienced in using his physical strength, but being a master of strategy and able to wield complex 
weaponry makes more than up for this.

We will release many more character classes in upcoming patches, 
including but not limiting to the Technomage, the Explorer or the Elder.


### Attributes

Every character has the 6 basic attributes

- Defense
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Experience
- Constitution
- Education

**Defense** is the ability to dodge attacks or to parry them. There is no difference made between pure physical 
attacks and technology supported ones.

**Strength** defines the pure physical strength, more strength means ultimately more damage in a physical fight.

**Dexterity** is the ability to execute coordinated moves with high precision. In game this is used to describe the 
ability of a character in using ranged weapons.

**Experience** is a value that represents the experiences and fights leading to the level of the character. 
Experience can not only be gained through winning combats but also by finding items or
 solving quests or being an active member of the Steemit community.

**Constitution** stands for the physical and mental resilience of a character. Actions within the game like fighting, 
require a certain constitution level and if executed subtract a certain amount from the value. 
Is the value of constitution reaching 0 a character needs to rest to regain or can use an item like a rejuvenation potion. 

**Education** has different purposes within the game. On the one hand side a character with a 
high education value can use more complex weaponry. On the other hand side quests could require a certain level of 
education as a prerequisite in order to be able to solve them.


Items within the game
------

There are 2 ways a character can get an item into his inventory.

- By finding the item. Some items are dropped within various postings on Steemit. 
If a player does read such a posting he might be rewarded with this item.

- Items can be purchased through the integrated shop system that is shipped with the 
software of STEEMPUNK-NET. Items purchased this way a directly available in the inventory.

Items do generally have the purpose of making the game more interesting and to increase the level of unpredictability 
of the outcome of a combat. It is also thought about including a class of legendary, extremely mighty items, 
which also could have monetary implications on a player and therefore will be in great demand. These legendary 
items will be unique within the game, meaning that only of them is existing at one time.

The list of items within STEEMPUNK-NEt can be divided into the following categories:


### List of item categories

- Weapons
    - Shotgun
    - Revolver
    - Raygun
    - Phaser
- Potions
    - Potion of Rejuvenation (replenishes constitution)
    - EduboostTM (increases education)
    - Exoskeleton (increases strength)
    - Neuraloverdrive (increases dexterity)
- Nodes
    - Nodes are carrying out research orders for you and support the character. 
    They are additionally needed to execute hacks. Nodes can only be purchased at the store.
- Energy shields and Armor
    - Energy shields are pure defensive items and increase the defense value of the 
    character using them.
    - Leather and Cloth Armor also increase the defensive value.


#### Legendary items

##### The Holy Private Key

One of the legendary items mentioned earlier is the Holy Private Key. 

This Item exists, just like all legendary items, just once within the world of STEEMPUNK-NET. 
This key does not grant any additional might or power to the character within the world, but it grants power over the meta-level 
of the game by granting the owner the possibility to acquire a certain percentage of the turnover from STEEMPUNK-NET.

The catch is that this is only possible if the Holy Private Key is within the inventory of a character for seven days in a row. 
If the current owner of the key gets challenged and loses the fight the key might be picked up by the challenger, 
but this is not successful in all cases.

If the key is held one week successfully a payment is issued directly and the key gets distributed randomly to a new player.


Combat system
------

The Combat system is the core of the game. We aim to have an evenly balanced game, 
playing more should for sure be rewarded more and investing into the game should also 
increase the chances to win on a general level. But we don’t want to have a pay2win game, 
so the increases will be noticeable but not overwhelming. 

Farming of low level chars will not be possible, security measures are not allowing to 
challenge a opponent that is more than 5 levels below or above the challenger.
This is also a measure to protect new characters within the game.

A basic algorithm for calculation of the results of a fight is already developed. 


### Battle Algorithm V1

The Battle Algorithm is currently using the following values within STEEMPUNK-NET and Steemit.

- Strength
- Defense
- Dexterity
- Experience
- Activity on Steemit

**What is meant with activity on Steemit and how does this influence the results in combat?**

Activity is calculated directly before a combat is taking place. An algorithm picks up 
data about actions on Steemit like authoring posts, commenting, curating and calculates 
an activity score per player.

All things that are beneficial for Steemit as a social media platform are also beneficial 
for the activity rating, so supporting Steemit leads ultimately to a high activity rating.

This activity score is then used within the overall battle calculation to determine the 
winner of a combat.


### Sequence of events in a combat

Directly after logging into the STEEMPUNK-NET system the graphical output on the screen 
will be enhanced with the specific functions for the game. 
This includes, for instance, an “Attack” button that appears if you are browsing the 
profile of another user who is also a player in STEEMPUNK-NET.

If this button is pressed the other player gets officially challenged. Starting with 
this moment the opponent has 2 hours to change items and to react to the challenge.

After expiration of those 2 hours the calculations will be executed and the winner proclaimed.


Turnover splitting
======

- 50% is directly going back to the players.
- 30% of the turnover is for the developers and the team.
- 10% is reserved for bug bounties.
- 10% is reserved to finance upcoming in game events.

Players will directly have a stake in the turnover of STEEMPUNK-NET. 
Top players will directly get a share of the total turnover, statistics will be posted weekly to show developments.

- Who won most combats?
- Who found most items?
- Who is the best rookie of the week?
- The holy private Key

All these statistics and all payouts will be done on a weekly basis. 
Having such a short reward timeframe ensures direct motivation, especially for smaller accounts.

There will also be a daily post, wrapping up all actions within the game for that specific day.

Generation of turnover
------

- **Purchasing items**. Players will have the option to buy items within the item shop. 
Items are either having a direct effect on the abilities of a char or a more cosmetic in nature.
- **Posts**. Statistics of the game will be published on a daily and a weekly basis. 
Additional to the daily ones the weekly posts will include also the leaderboards of the game and 
the payout volumes to the players. Naturally these posts can be upvoted as well.
- New features, stories and new items will also be discussed publicly with the players and will also be voteable.
- Items can have an unique story and a special name, allowing to create special items in cooperation 
with one or more players. This is the chance to have an item named after you, but this opportunities will be 
limited and for sure will have price tag.  
- Furthermore, a lot of different events, like quests or theme weeks, will take place.
